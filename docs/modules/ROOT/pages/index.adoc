= openshift4-ingress: A Commodore component to manage OpenShift 4 Ingress Controller

{doctitle} is a Commodore component for Managing the OpenShift 4 https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/networking/configuring_ingress_cluster_traffic/configuring-ingress-cluster-traffic-ingress-controller.html#configuring-ingress-cluster-traffic-ingress-controller[ingress controller].


== Wildcard Certificates

If no `defaultCertificate` is specified for an ingress controller, a Let's Encrypt wildcard certificate is provisioned.
This requires the domain to be set up so that https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge[dns-01-challenge] can be used.


=== Supported DNS Services

The following DNS service providers are currently implemented:

* GCP (tested)
* AWS (untested)
* Azure (untested)

If your cluster is running on a different cloud provider you must use one of the https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/#supported-dns01-providers[supported DNS01 providers] in order to use Let's Encrypt wildcard certificates.
